// Lock that every workflow YAML in this repo parses cleanly.
//
// TypeScript sibling of `portfolio-ops/tests/test_workflows_yaml_parseable.py`
// (portfolio-ops#30 / portfolio-ops#31), modelled after the Python ports
// shipped to llm-eval-harness#61, rag-production-kit#53, and
// chunking-strategies-lab#40.
//
// The original lock was written because PR portfolio-ops#27 /
// portfolio-ops#28 closed a 21-day silent CI outage caused by a single
// unquoted colon-space in a `run:` value:
//
//     - name: Verify D-001 baseline decision exists
//       run: grep -q "id: D-001" MEMORY/core_decisions_ai.md
//
// `yaml.load()` would reject the line with `YAMLException: mapping
// values are not allowed here`. GitHub Actions' parser is lenient
// enough to *complete* the workflow run with zero jobs and
// `conclusion=failure`; `statusCheckRollup` stays empty so Phase A
// auto-merge can't tell that no CI ran.
//
// `nextjs-streaming-ai-patterns`'s workflows use the `run: |` block-
// scalar form today and are YAML-safe, so this lock is the inverse
// safety net: it makes the unparseable-shape failure *cannot* land here
// either. A `jobs:` non-empty assertion catches the broader "valid
// YAML, no actual workflow" failure mode in case GitHub Actions
// silently absorbs another shape the same way.
//
// Related: portfolio-ops#27, portfolio-ops#28, portfolio-ops#30,
// llm-eval-harness#60, agent-orchestration-platform#41,
// mcp-server-cookbook#46, this repo's #34.
