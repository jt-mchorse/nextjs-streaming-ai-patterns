// Lock that every workflow file has a top-level `concurrency:` group.
//
// Companion to `workflows-yaml-parseable.test.ts` and
// `workflows-timeout-minutes.test.ts` — same silent-rot prevention
// arc, different failure mode. Propagation of the Python canonical
// first hop in `llm-eval-harness#64` and the audit-side fingerprint
// in `portfolio-ops#41` (`audit_phase_a.py --check missing-concurrency`).
//
// The failure mode this catches: without a `concurrency:` group, a
// rapid push-on-push (rebased session branch force-pushed, PR chain
// merged in quick succession, contributor amending mid-flight) burns
// one full CI run per push even though the in-flight run is
// immediately superseded. For this repo's `app` job (npm ci + lint +
// typecheck + vitest + Next.js build) that's meaningful operator
// savings during back-and-forth review iterations.
//
// Spec / origin: this repo's #38.
