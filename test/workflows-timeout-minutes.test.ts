// Lock that every workflow job has a sensible `timeout-minutes` bound.
//
// Companion to `workflows-yaml-parseable.test.ts` (this repo's #34 /
// PR #35, propagated from portfolio-ops#30) — same silent-rot prevention
// arc, different failure mode. First TypeScript hop of the
// timeout-minutes lock that landed first as Python in
// `llm-eval-harness#63`, `rag-production-kit#55`,
// `chunking-strategies-lab#42`, and surfaced as a fingerprint in
// `portfolio-ops#36` (`audit_phase_a.py --check missing-timeout`).
//
// The failure mode this catches: GitHub Actions defaults to 360
// minutes (6 hours) per job when no `timeout-minutes` is set. A hung
// job — `npm ci` stalling on a registry, infinite typecheck loop,
// Playwright stuck waiting for the Next.js dev server — therefore
// burns the full 6-hour ceiling before the runner kills it. That's
// quota the operator pays for whether the run produced anything or not.
//
// Spec / origin: this repo's #36.
